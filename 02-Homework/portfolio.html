                <h3>Hustle Data</h3>
                <p>This is the first of three projects I was required to completed during my BootCamp through Columbia University. My team and I have created a fintech application that caters to newer investors. Our sleek and smooth design makes this an easy to comprehend application while providing necessary information to make cognitive investing decisions.</p>

                <p>Here is a link to one of my homework assignments. The objective was to create an interactive Weather Dashboard. By searching a city in the search bar, the current weather and five day forecast populate on the screen. It's a nice tool to use and update throughout time. </p>

            <h5>JavaScript</h5>

            <p>This was some of my first ever work with JavaScript. It was some of my better work to date, please feel free to take at the code to see how this was built out. It was something I found difficult at first but as time goes on I feel I will end up being much more proficient within JavaScript. <a>https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tUbkOKdimDXvqgt58Z4DsbnvY3K_Ye1m?usp=sharing</a></p>

            <p>Here is a link that to a game that I created for my current class copy and paste if you would like to test it out. Please take a look and let me know your thoughts. As time goes on, I will be able to make changes to the game to improve some aspects of the game. <a>https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/414628000</a></p>
