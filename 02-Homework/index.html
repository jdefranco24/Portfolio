        <p class="text-justify">Hello everybody and welcome to my page! I am a 26 year old college graduate from the SUNY Oswego. I recieved my Bachleors of Science in Accounting, and went right into my MBA with a concentration on Accounting.It took me 5 years to complete this program and I can tell you right it was a long and challenging five years.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">It took me a few internships to realize that I only enjoyed accounting for the business side of things. For example, you can take a look at a company's 10K and know what that company is all about. It allows you to understand almost any business you enter and that was something I used to my advantage when I enetered the workforce.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Out of college, I went into analytics. It was something I had no idea about but was willing to learn. As time went on, I realized I was pretty good at all the mathmatics and data comparsion but where fell short was the software aspect of things. I have always enjoyed software and the mysteries behind, but I was not the best at it. So I decided that would pursue something that I really enjoyed and that was software. Which brings me to now. I am currently attending a coding bootcamp through the University of Columbia. The more the course continues, the more I realize i ahve made a career changing decision and I absolutely love it. I really look forward to what the future has in store for me. </p>
        <p class="text-justify">A little bit about myself. I am a huge New York Jets fan and New York Yankee fan. I have lovely fiance and we were supposed to get married August 2020 but had move the date to next September. My bestfriend is my dog Apollo. He is 2 and half years and he is a yellow lab. I take every where I go and I couldn't imagine not having the big guy in my life. I enjoy cooking (smoking meat), working out, hiking and camping, spending time withe my family and I enjoy playing video games.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">I hope you all enjoy my page and good luck with everything in the future.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Take Care,</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Joe DeFranco</p>
